# 2019 San Francisco Shock Overwatch League Playoff Highlights

## Background & Motivation
Always interested in some sort of sports, not necessarily mainstream sports like
basketball or football, esports was an enjoyment to watch in seeing skill and teamwork
at work. Specifically, the game Overwatch, a team based multiplayer first-person
shooter game. It assigns players in two teams of six and each player selects from a
large pool of characters with unique abilities. Teams work and battle to complete
map-specific objectives within a limited period of time. As for the Overwatch League,
the San Francisco Shock is one of the teams in the league and a favorite team of
mine. I want to be able to represent and highlight the SF Shock with all their successes
from this season.
