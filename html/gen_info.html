            <h2>Game Information</h2>
            <h3>Player Roles</h3>
            <p>
                Every character in Overwatch is split into 3 roles: tank, damage, and support.
                Each team of 6 players is composed of 2 tanks, 2 damage, and 2 supports,
                this format is colloquially known as 2-2-2. Each role has their own jobs and specializations.
                Tanks are front-liners designed to both protect your team and disrupt the enemies.
                They have the most HP out of the other characters and have abilities that protect themselves
                and teammates as well as crowd control to disrupt the enemies. Damage, also known as DPS,
                are designed to deal damage with the varied tools. Some excel at close range combat,
                others output damage from a distance, and others flank to disrupt the backline using their mobility.
                Finally, supports are back-liners that heal, buff allies or debuff enemies, or provide utility.
                As a result the strongest abilities in the game are given to the supports, whether it’s to help keep
                your allies alive or provide the utility for your team to turn a fight.
            </p>
            <h3>Meta Changes</h3>
            <p>
                Overwatch was not always locked into 2-2-2. Before the playoffs, your team could be
                composed of anyone from the roster, you could have 5 damage and 1 support or have 5 supports and 1 tank.
                The reason the developers changed to 2-2-2 was due to a meta known as GOATS, which is composed of
                3 tanks and 3 support heroes. This meta got its name due to a Contenders Team (Tier Two) using this
                name to completely wipe their competition. With 30 playable characters at the time, seeing the same
                6 heroes with the occasional variance being played game after game for the better part of a year left
                a sour taste in both the players and fans' mouths. OWL players signed for their damage characters were
                forced onto tank or support heroes they do not play, and if they couldn't play them well enough,
                they were benched. Games became a matter of who could get their ultimates first and who could vomit
                them all up faster. Overwatch as a whole became boring to both watch and play. The developers could
                not even fix this meta through balance patches, as it’d require a significant nerf of a couple
                characters, effectively killing them (making them practically unplayable because of how weak they’d
                be compared to the rest of the roster). As a result, 2-2-2 was introduced and implemented,
                although it was not a perfect solution, it was a necessary one to stop the rampage of GOATS.
            </p>
            <h3>Map Types</h3>
            <h4>Assualt</h4>
            <p>
                There are 4 different types of maps in Overwatch: Assault, Escort, Control, and Hybrid.
                Assault, or colloquially known as 2CP involves the capture of 2 points. To capture a point,
                the attacking team must have players capturing the zone with no defenders in the same zone.
                Each point has 3 checkpoints of capture progress, one at 33%, one at 66% and one at 100%.
                If the defending team manages to push the attacking team off the point before any of these
                checkpoints are reached, the progress will reset to the previous checkpoint. For example,
                if the attackers managed to get the progress to 50% and they get forced off, the progress
                will be reset to 33% rather than 0. Once the first point is captured, the second point will
                be available to capture. Attackers have 5 minutes to defend the first point, once the first
                point is taken, 4 more minutes will be added onto the clock for the next point.
            </p>
            <h4>Escort</h4>
            <p>
                Escort is a mode that involves the attackers pushing a payload to the destination. The payload
                will move as long as there are attackers in the vicinity of the payload, the payload will be
                stopped if there are any defenders in the vicinity as well. The payload will also slowly move
                backwards while there are no attackers in its vicinity. Before the final destination of the payload,
                there are 2 checkpoints that once taken, will push the spawns of the attackers forward and the
                defenders back, progress on the payload cannot be pushed back past the checkpoint. Attackers
                have 5 minutes to reach the first checkpoint, once the first checkpoint is reached, 3 more minutes
                will be added to the clock. Once the second checkpoint is reached, 2 more minutes will be added to
                the clock for the attackers to push the payload to the final destination.
            </p>
            <h4>Control</h4>
            <p>
                Control is a mode that involves a neutral point that both teams need to fight over.
                Progress on the point will begin for the team that captures it by being the only team on the point
                for a period of time. Progress will continue to go up for the team until the other team recaptures
                it by being the only team on the point for a period of time. Control takes place on 3 different maps
                in a best of 3 format.
            </p>
            <h4>Hybrid</h4>
            <p>
                Hybrid is a mode that combines the first point of Assault with the Escort mechanic. Attackers have
                5 minutes to take a point that functions identically to the first point of Assault. Once the point
                is captured, a payload spawns and the attackers will have to escort the payload just like they do in
                Escort. The attackers get 3 minutes added to the clock for taking the point. There is only 1 checkpoint
                for the Escort part of Hybrid, and reaching it will add 2 minutes to the clock.
