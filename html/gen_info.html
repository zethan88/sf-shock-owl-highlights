            <h2>Game Information</h2>
            <p>
                There are many readers who are not well versed in the video game of Overwatch so this page
                helps inform those what and how Overwatch works.
            </p>
            <h3>General</h3>
            <p>
                Overwatch is a team based multiplayer first-person shooter game.
                It assigns players in two teams of six and each player selects from a large
                pool of characters with a unique kit of abilities. Teams work and battle to complete
                map-specific objectives within a limited period of time. Each match lasts up to a certain
                amount of rounds and only either team can win or a game ends in a draw. Broadly, the
                goal is to work with team members to eliminate or repel opponents while attacking,
                defending, or competing for an objective.

            <br><br>
            <h3>Player Roles</h3>
            <p>
                Every character in Overwatch is split into 3 roles: tank, damage, and support.
                Each team of 6 players is composed of 2 tanks, 2 damage, and 2 supports,
                this format is colloquially known as 2-2-2. Each role has their own jobs and specializations.
                Tanks are front-liners designed to both protect your team and disrupt the enemies.
                They have the most HP out of the other characters and have abilities that protect themselves
                and teammates as well as crowd control to disrupt the enemies. Damage, also known as DPS,
                are designed to deal damage with the varied tools. Some excel at close range combat,
                others output damage from a distance, and others flank to disrupt the backline using their mobility.
                Finally, supports are back-liners that heal, buff allies or debuff enemies, or provide utility.
                As a result the strongest abilities in the game are given to the supports, whether it’s to help keep
                your allies alive or provide the utility for your team to turn a fight.
            </p>
            <h3>Meta Changes</h3>
            <p>
                Overwatch was not always locked into 2-2-2. Before the playoffs, your team could be
                composed of anyone from the roster, you could have 5 damage and 1 support or have 5 supports and 1 tank.
                The reason the developers changed to 2-2-2 was due to a meta known as GOATS, which is composed of
                3 tanks and 3 support heroes. This meta got its name due to a Contenders Team (Tier Two) using this
                name to completely wipe their competition. With 30 playable characters at the time, seeing the same
                6 heroes with the occasional variance being played game after game for the better part of a year left
                a sour taste in both the players and fans' mouths. OWL players signed for their damage characters were
                forced onto tank or support heroes they do not play, and if they couldn't play them well enough,
                they were benched. Games became a matter of who could get their ultimates first and who could vomit
                them all up faster. Overwatch as a whole became boring to both watch and play. The developers could
                not even fix this meta through balance patches, as it’d require a significant nerf of a couple
                characters, effectively killing them (making them practically unplayable because of how weak they’d
                be compared to the rest of the roster). As a result, 2-2-2 was introduced and implemented,
                although it was not a perfect solution, it was a necessary one to stop the rampage of GOATS.
            </p>
            <h3>Map Types</h3>
            <h4>Assault</h4>
            <p>
                There are 4 different types of maps in Overwatch: Assault, Escort, Control, and Hybrid.
                Assault, or colloquially known as 2CP involves the capture of 2 points. To capture a point,
                the attacking team must have players capturing the zone with no defenders in the same zone.
                Each point has 3 checkpoints of capture progress, one at 33%, one at 66% and one at 100%.
                If the defending team manages to push the attacking team off the point before any of these
                checkpoints are reached, the progress will reset to the previous checkpoint. For example,
                if the attackers managed to get the progress to 50% and they get forced off, the progress
                will be reset to 33% rather than 0. Once the first point is captured, the second point will
                be available to capture. Attackers have 5 minutes to defend the first point, once the first
                point is taken, 4 more minutes will be added onto the clock for the next point.
            </p>
            <h4>Payload</h4>
            <p>
                Payload or escort is a mode that involves the attackers pushing/escorting a payload to the
                destination. The payload will move as long as there are attackers in the vicinity of the payload,
                the payload will be stopped if there are any defenders in the vicinity as well. The payload will
                also slowly move backwards while there are no attackers in its vicinity. Before the final destination
                of the payload, there are 2 checkpoints that once taken, will push the spawns of the attackers forward
                and the defenders back, progress on the payload cannot be pushed back past the checkpoint. Attackers
                have 5 minutes to reach the first checkpoint, once the first checkpoint is reached, 3 more minutes
                will be added to the clock. Once the second checkpoint is reached, 2 more minutes will be added to
                the clock for the attackers to push the payload to the final destination.
            </p>
            <h4>Control</h4>
            <p>
                Control is a mode that involves a neutral point that both teams need to fight over.
                Progress on the point will begin for the team that captures it by being the only team on the point
                for a period of time. Progress will continue to go up for the team until the other team recaptures
                it by being the only team on the point for a period of time. Control takes place on 3 different maps
                in a best of 3 format.
            </p>
            <h4>Hybrid</h4>
            <p>
                Hybrid is a mode that combines the first point of Assault with the Escort mechanic. Attackers have
                5 minutes to take a point that functions identically to the first point of Assault. Once the point
                is captured, a payload spawns and the attackers will have to escort the payload just like they do in
                Escort. The attackers get 3 minutes added to the clock for taking the point. There is only 1 checkpoint
                for the Escort part of Hybrid, and reaching it will add 2 minutes to the clock.
            </p>
            <h3>The Overwatch League</h3>
            <p>
                The Overwatch League™ (O.W.L.) is an international esports league comprising
                20 city-based teams and featuring the best Overwatch® players in the world.
                Showcasing top-tier Overwatch competition, thrilling storylines,
                an eye-popping prize pool, robust viewership rewards,
                and cutting-edge production value, the Overwatch League is the
                world's premier esports league. The league was announced in 2016 with its inaugural
                season taking place in 2018, with a total prize pool of US $3.5 million given to
                team(s) that year.
            </p>
            <h4>Overwatch League Format</h4>
            <p>
                The Overwatch League is owned by Blizzard Entertainment and run by Major League Gaming,
                which is also owned by Blizzard's parent company Activision Blizzard. The Overwatch
                League plays out similar to most North American professional sports leagues,
                in which all teams play scheduled games against other teams to vie for position
                in the season's playoffs, rather than the approach of team promotion and relegation
                more commonly used in other esports leagues. The league currently features twenty
                teams split between two conferences based on their location: East and West.
                The East will have eight teams, while the West will have twelve.<br>

                <br>The 2018 season consisted of non-regulation pre-season play, a regular season
                divided into four stages, and a post-season playoffs tournament to determine the
                championship team for the season. Each regular season stage lasted five weeks,
                with each stage ending with a short playoff of the top teams based on that stage's
                records to determine stage champions. Teams played 40 matches across the regular
                season, playing teams both within and outside their division. The post-season
                playoffs used teams' overall standings across all stages. The top standing team
                in both divisions received the top two seed in the playoffs, followed by a fixed
                number of teams determined from across both divisions. An All-Star weekend is
                also held, featuring two division-based teams selected by league representatives
                and voted on by fans.<br>

                <br>The 2019 season format was similar to that of the previous season, though
                stage playoffs for the fourth stage were eliminated and the number of matches was
                decreased to 28, among other changes. The 2020 season introduced a number of changes,
                including a home-and-away format, where each team would host home games with up to
                eight teams per homestand event, and the elimination of the stage format. This format
                was eventually changed to a bimonthly tournament-based season in April due to the
                global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>

                <br>Teams are awarded with monetary prizes for how they place at the end of the
                regular season, as well as for participating and placing high in the stage playoffs
                and post-season tournament. For example, the first season had a total prize pool of
                US $3.5 million available, with the top prize of $1 million awarded to the post-season
                championship team.
