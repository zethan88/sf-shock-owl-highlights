            <h2>Player Performances</h2>
            <p>
                A player's performance can be perceived on various statistical measurements used in game. But
                a consistent use of measurement across all players is the amount of their damage and/or healing
                done. Every hero can inflict damage onto an opponent, but not all heroes can heal themselves or
                their teammates. Specifically, only players with the Support hero role can be able to heal their
                teammates. Healing is a vital source of keeping your team alive in the fight, so measuring a Support
                player's healing output along with their damage output, really defines a player's role and performance.
                Below are each of the San Francisco Shock players' performances during the 2019 Playoffs based
                on the sum of all damage done and healing done.

                This bar chart displays the players' performance based on the sum of damage done
                and healing done. Right of the bat, two players with high damage done and healing done are
                Choihyobin and Viol2t, respectively. It can be clearly deduced that the Tank role duo Choihyobin
                and smurf present massive amounts of damage output as front-lining Tanks. Their role to
                keep the team moving and alive in both defending and attacking is vital to a team's success.
                The next pair, STRIKER and Viol2t, present their output of damage as Damage and Flex roles,
                respectively. Usually Damage roles output very high damage, they still contribute to the
                team in applying flanks and aggression on the enemy as well as finishing off enemies. Expected of
                their high eliminations, but secondary for their damage done.
                Onto healing done, the clear main Support duo are moth and Viol2t, with Viol2t leading the
                highest amount of healing output and moth coming second of the highest healing output. Noted that
                Choihyobin has nearly a zero healing done, which to be fair, his main role is Tank, but it can be
                assumed he has some healing done due to switching to a support hero for emergency.
                This graph also signifies Viol2t's excellent performance: second in damage done and top in healing
                done.<br>
                <br>Overall, the San Francisco Shock's players' performance can still be defined by many other
                measures and factors, in reporting these ones, still captures the San Francisco Shock's
                strength and domination in the season.
